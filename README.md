This project involves performing Sentiment Analysis on textual data such as customer reviews, tweets, or user comments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis is a type of classification task where the goal is to determine whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

The dataset used in this project consists of text entries along with corresponding sentiment labels. The text is first cleaned through a series of preprocessing steps such as converting to lowercase, removing special characters, stopwords, URLs, mentions, and applying stemming. This step is crucial for reducing noise and ensuring that the model focuses on meaningful patterns in the text.

For feature extraction, the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique is used to convert the preprocessed text into numerical vectors suitable for machine learning algorithms. The model used for sentiment classification is Logistic Regression, a simple yet effective algorithm for text classification tasks.

The dataset is split into training and testing subsets. The model is trained on the training data and evaluated using standard metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy on the test data. A confusion matrix is also plotted to visualize the performance across different sentiment categories.

Additionally, the project includes visualizations such as bar charts for classification metrics and a heatmap for the confusion matrix. Sample predictions are demonstrated using real input examples to showcase the practical application of the model.

This project highlights the end-to-end workflow of an NLP pipeline: from raw text data to model evaluation. It provides a strong foundation for further advancements using deep learning techniques such as LSTM or transformer-based models like BERT.
